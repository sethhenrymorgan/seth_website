Hi friends! As you know by now we've got two (!) little ones incoming in September. If you're here, you might be looking for registry information, so see below for registry, shipping details and second-hand/hand-me-down requests. But mostly we hope that you'll join us in celebrating these new lives and that you'll send us your prayers, wishes, and judicious advice as we prepare for a twin tornado of baby-dom to come into our world.

## Registry

We are registered at [Target](https://www.target.com/gift-registry/giftgiver?registryId=4b43035870a14e3fb5bb9dd1fd284808&lnk=registry_custom_url) if you're in the gifting mood. Note that Target allows folks to pitch in toward the bigger-ticket items so feel free to jump in on the car seats or such if you're so inclined. That's a particularly good option for out-of-town friends because getting Target to ship stuff to our house in Duke Forest is sometimes iffy. It usually gets to us eventually, but often via the kind intervention of the Lemur Center staff. If you want to send something our way via snail mail see below.

## Shipping

Cards and small items can come to our address at 3701 Erwin Rd. Durham, NC 27705. That's also where non-USPS orders can go, though please send us the tracking information so we can keep tabs on them. Packages can be sent via USPS to PO Box 94196, Durham, NC 27708. And if you're stopping by and you've never visited, forget all that. Just text and we'll tell you how to actually get to our place. It's weird y'all.

## Second-Hand Items

Getting two of everything adds up! Here are some things we're looking to beg, borrow, thrift, or otherwise get used. Some of these items are on the registry as well, but it seems worth it to try to save a bit. Let us know if you've got any of these items to sell or hand down!

* Baby carriers (e.g. ErgoBaby)
* Bassinet/co-sleeper (the Arm's Reach models look big enough for two)
* Changing table or dresser
* Oversize chair
* Bouncy chairs
* Swings or jumpers
* Baby clothes--any age
